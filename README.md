# Ateljé Angelina

We all need an ateljé.

This project was generated using the express generator.

To run on powershell in devmode:
`npm run start`.

## Design

We have a list of sewing patterns, and a list of sewing projects. Each sewing project references a sewing pattern.

We are going to be able to log projects, with notes on how it was made/altered, and what to think of next time. Also, fabric composition so I'll remember, especially when I need to do laundry.
We are also going to create a better references for the patterns that I own, so I don't end up with too many too similare patterns. And for inspo.

## Features to be implemented

- List projects.
- Show individual projects.
- Search patterns, and search projects. Filtering.
- Create new entries.
- Edit existing entries.
- Image hosting.
- A frontend, this has started out as a BE coding project, but it will have to look acceptable at some point. Brutalism is not popular enough.
